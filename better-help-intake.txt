What brings you here?
Seeking weekly assistance with some constructive transitions I am making in my life.

Most important is to reduce my reactiveness when under stress. Basic anger management stuff + shame + reluctance to accept help.

I see that learning when I need help is crucial, as I tend to be very autonomous.

So, I see the following as a good framing to start with:
- help with what?
- why hard to accept that it may be needed?
- help from whom/what?
- how might that entity help?

Thanks
